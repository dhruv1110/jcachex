## Critical Optimizations Required

### 1. Window TinyLFU Algorithm Implementation

**Description:** Replace current eviction strategies with Window TinyLFU admission policy.

**Key Components:**
- **Frequency Sketch:** 4-bit CountMinSketch for probabilistic frequency tracking
- **Admission Window:** Small LRU cache for new entries to build frequency
- **Main Space:** Segmented LRU with protected (80%) and probationary (20%) segments
- **Aging Process:** Periodic halving of counters to maintain fresh history

**Implementation Details:**
```java
public class WindowTinyLFUPolicy<K, V> {
    private final FrequencySketch<K> sketch;
    private final LRUCache<K, V> admissionWindow;
    private final SegmentedLRUCache<K, V> mainSpace;
    private final AdaptiveResizer resizer;

    public boolean shouldAdmit(K candidateKey, K victimKey) {
        int candidateFreq = sketch.frequency(candidateKey);
        int victimFreq = sketch.frequency(victimKey);
        return candidateFreq > victimFreq;
    }
}
```

**Performance Impact:** Expected 40-50% improvement in hit ratio

### 2. Frequency Sketch (CountMinSketch) Implementation

**Description:** Implement a 4-bit CountMinSketch for efficient frequency tracking.

**Key Features:**
- **4-bit counters:** Balance between accuracy and memory usage
- **Multiple hash functions:** Spread hash collisions
- **Minimal increment:** Only increment smallest counters
- **Doorkeeper:** Single-bit bloom filter for rare items

**Implementation Strategy:**
```java
public class FrequencySketch<K> {
    private final long[] table;
    private final int blockMask;
    private final int sampleSize;
    private final AtomicLong size;

    public void increment(K key) {
        // Apply multiple hash functions
        int hash1 = spread(key.hashCode());
        int hash2 = rehash(hash1);

        // Find minimum counters and increment
        incrementMinimal(hash1, hash2);
    }
}
```

### 3. Lock-Free Read Operations

**Description:** Implement lock-free reads using ring buffers and write-ahead logging.

**Key Components:**
- **Striped Ring Buffers:** Thread-specific buffers for access recording
- **Write-Ahead Log:** Batch operations for policy updates
- **Asynchronous Draining:** Background thread processes logged operations

**Implementation Strategy:**
```java
public class ConcurrentAccessLogger<K> {
    private final RingBuffer<K>[] readBuffers;
    private final WriteBuffer<K> writeBuffer;
    private final AtomicLong drainStatus;

    public void recordAccess(K key) {
        int stripe = getStripe(Thread.currentThread());
        if (!readBuffers[stripe].offer(key)) {
            scheduleDrain();
        }
    }
}
```

**Performance Impact:** Expected 60-70% improvement in read scalability

### 4. Memory Layout Optimizations

**Description:** Optimize data structures for better CPU cache utilization.

**Key Optimizations:**
- **Field Ordering:** Place frequently accessed fields first
- **Bit Packing:** Pack boolean flags into single fields
- **Object Pooling:** Reuse objects to reduce allocation
- **Compressed References:** Use int indices instead of object references

**Implementation Example:**
```java
public class OptimizedCacheEntry<V> {
    // Hot fields first (CPU cache line optimization)
    private final V value;
    private final int keyHash;
    private final long metadata; // packed: weight(32) + flags(32)

    // Cold fields last
    private volatile long accessTimeNanos;
    private volatile int accessCount;
}
```

### 5. Hierarchical Timer Wheel

**Description:** Implement efficient time-based operations using hierarchical timer wheels.

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Resolution Levels:** [64,64,32,4,1] buckets with different spans
- **Bit Manipulation:** Fast bucket calculation using shifts and masks
- **Cascading:** Events move from coarse to fine resolution

**Implementation:**
```java
public class TimerWheel<K> {
    private final Node<K>[][] wheels;
    private final long[] spans;
    private final int[] shifts;

    public void schedule(K key, long delay) {
        int level = findLevel(delay);
        int bucket = calculateBucket(delay, level);
        wheels[level][bucket].add(key);
    }
}
```
